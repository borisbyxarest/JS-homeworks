           <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
           <p><div>
                Two households, both alike in dignity,
                In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
                From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
                Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
                From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
                A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
                Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
                Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
                The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
                And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
          <nobr>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</nobr><br>
                Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
                The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
          <nobr>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</nobr> </div></p>
      <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
      <h3>SAMPSON</h3>
      <p>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
      <h3>GREGORY</h3>
       <p>
No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
